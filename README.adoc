Since parts were vibe-coded, society has already paid the price
in terms of climate-damaging emissions from AI data centers,
so this app and any derivatives will not,
and can not legally (by its license), be monetized.

== Launcher Icons

If you change images/soi-logo.png, you should run

    flutter pub get
    dart run flutter_launcher_icons:main
